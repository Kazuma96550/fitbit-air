The full license text is included in [`LICENSE-APACHE-2.0`](LICENSE-APACHE-2.0).

The native libraries under `android/src/main/jniLibs/` are built from this
source by [`tool/native/build.py`](tool/native/build.py) without modification;
upstream's `NOTICE` is reproduced in
[`third_party/golden-gate/NOTICE`](third_party/golden-gate/NOTICE).

The Kotlin sources under
`android/src/main/kotlin/com/fitbit/goldengate/bindings/` are derived from the
upstream Android bindings and retain their SPDX headers. They include limited
adaptations: a per-stack TLS key resolver and logging cleanups.
