/**
 * Passive view of the shared tracker channel before our session starts.
 *
 * Every GATT client on the link receives the Air's tracker notifications.
 * Google Health's foreground polling is about 107 bytes per second; a sync is
 * a burst of large packets (thousands of bytes per second). Starting our
 * session during a sync makes that sync fail, so commands wait until the
 * channel is quiet, bounded by [maxHoldMillis] so alerts are never held
 * indefinitely. Only timing and sizes are recorded; payloads are encrypted.
 *
 * A silent channel starts after [quietStartMillis]: Google Health's syncs and
 * polling produce traffic well within that time. With a warm link the history
 * is already known, so [observeMillis] can be zero.
